    """
    PyTorch reference implementation of the scatter_add kernel.

    Equivalent to ``input.scatter_add(dim=0, index=index_2d, src=src)``, i.e.
    performs ``input[index[i], j] += src[i, j]`` for all ``i, j``.
    Called by ``torch_ref_wrapper``, which converts numpy arrays to torch
    tensors before invoking this function. The 1D ``index`` is expanded to
    match ``src``'s shape to satisfy ``torch.scatter_add``'s shape requirements.

    Args:
        input (torch.Tensor): [N, D], Destination tensor to accumulate into.
        dim (int): Dimension along which to scatter. Must be 0 to match the kernel contract.
        index (torch.Tensor): [K], 1D integer tensor of row indices into ``input``.
        src (torch.Tensor): [K, D], Source values to scatter-add.

    Returns:
        dict[str, torch.Tensor]: ``{"output": input_after}`` where ``input_after`` is
            ``input`` with ``src`` rows scatter-added at rows given by ``index``.

    Notes:
        - ``index`` is cast to int64 and broadcast to ``src``'s shape to satisfy
          ``torch.scatter_add``'s requirement that ``index`` and ``src`` share shape.
        - Only ``dim == 0`` is supported, matching the kernel's restriction.
