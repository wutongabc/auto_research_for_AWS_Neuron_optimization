    PyTorch reference implementation of dynamic elementwise addition.

    This is a reference implementation for testing the NKI dynamic_elementwise_add kernel.
    It computes the same mathematical operation using PyTorch.

    Args:
        input_a (torch.Tensor): [M, H], First input tensor.
        input_b (torch.Tensor): [M, H], Second input tensor, same shape as input_a.
        num_m_tiles: Unused. Present to match kernel signature for UnitTestFramework validation.

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: [M, H], Elementwise sum of input_a and input_b.
    """
    return input_a + input_b
