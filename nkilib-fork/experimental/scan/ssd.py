    """State Space Duality (SSD) scan for Mamba-2 prefill.

    Dispatches between two internal implementations based on the number of
    heads, which determines how effectively B/C projections amortize:

    - Head-outer (nheads < 8): State stays in SBUF across chunks. Better when
      few heads make B/C sharing savings small relative to state HBM traffic.
    - Chunk-outer (nheads >= 8): B/C loaded once per chunk, shared across heads.
      Better at real model head counts where sharing amortizes across many heads.

    The threshold reflects the crossover observed on Trainium hardware — below
    ~8 local heads (post-TP sharding), head-outer wins; above, chunk-outer wins.

    Dimensions:
        batch: Batch size.
        nheads: Number of SSM heads (post-TP sharding).
        seqlen: Sequence length (must be divisible by chunk_size).
        headdim: Per-head dimension. Tiled when > 512.
        dstate: SSM state dimension (<= 128 for partition dimension).
        Q: Chunk size (= chunk_size, <= 128).

    Args:
        x (nl.ndarray): [batch, nheads, seqlen, headdim], Input activations.
        dt (nl.ndarray): [batch, nheads, seqlen], Softplus'd timesteps. Must be positive.
        A (nl.ndarray): [nheads], State transition scalars. Typically negative.
        B (nl.ndarray): [batch, seqlen, dstate], Input projection.
        C (nl.ndarray): [batch, seqlen, dstate], Output projection.
        chunk_size (int): Chunk size for parallel scan. Must be <= 128.
        D (nl.ndarray, optional): [nheads], Skip connection weights.
        initial_state (nl.ndarray, optional): [batch, nheads, dstate, headdim], Initial
            SSM state. Default: None (zeros).
        causal_mask (nl.ndarray): [Q, Q], Lower-triangular mask. Required.
            Pass np.tril(np.ones((Q, Q), dtype=np.float32)).

    Returns:
        tuple: (y, final_state)
            - y (nl.ndarray): [batch, nheads, seqlen, headdim], Output, same dtype as x.
            - final_state (nl.ndarray): [batch, nheads, dstate, headdim], Final SSM state
              in float32.

    Notes:
        - chunk_size <= 128 (must fit in partition dimension)
        - dstate <= 128 (must fit in partition dimension for SBUF state)
        - seqlen must be divisible by chunk_size
        - ngroups=1 (B/C shared across all heads)
        - Uses float32 accumulation internally for numerical stability
        - A should be negative for stable dynamics (decay < 1)
        - dt should be positive; discretization computes exp(dt * A)
        - TODO: dstate > 128 support via tiled state through HBM (needed for
          Falcon-H1 1.5B+ which uses dstate=256)
        - TODO: ngroups > 1 support via per-group B/C projections (needed for
          Zamba2-7B ngroups=2, Falcon-H1 34B ngroups=2). Assign groups to
          NeuronCores so each core only loads its groups' B/C — avoids
          replication when ngroups divides evenly across LNC cores.
