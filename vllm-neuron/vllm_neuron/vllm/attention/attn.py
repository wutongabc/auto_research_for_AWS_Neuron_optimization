    The class implements AttentionBackend for Neuron.

    Key Notes:
    1/ When integrated with vLLM Neuron, this class is intentionally a read-only, stateless specification.
    Its sole purpose is to describe the attention capabilities supported by Neuron, enabling vLLM
    features to query its APIs and derive the correct Neuron-specific configuration. The actual attention
    implementation is provided by vLLM Neuron as part of the modeling code. This separation of responsibilities
    is a deliberate design choice as we want to keep vLLM Neuron independent of serving frameworks.

    2/ For vLLM Native, this design is expected to evolve. In that case, a full attention module will
    likely be implemented directly via NeuronAttentionBackend and integrated with the native vLLM modeling code.
