"""Block packing utilities for the Qwen3-VL vision encoder.

Packs variable-size images into fixed-size blocks for compile stability.
Each function is independently testable with explicit parameters.

Layers:
  1. ffd_pack_images — pure FFD bin-packing algorithm
  2. scatter_to_blocks — scatter flat tensors into block layout
  3. compute_block_bounds — block-local attention bounds
  4. compute_unpack_indices — post-merger gather indices
  5. select_vision_bucket — bucket selection from configured list
