    Output Projection API that automatically selects between NKI kernels and PyTorch fallback.

    This function checks kernel constraints and dispatches to:

    Args:

            - NONE: bf16 / fp16
            - STATIC: ``torch.float8_e4m3fn`` in row-major layout
            - STATIC_MX (TRN3-only): ``torch.float8_e4m3fn`` pre-shuffled
              host-side via the loader's reshape-transpose (see
              ``weight_loaders_mxfp8.py:_mx_shuffle_o_proj``). The kernel
              consumes the 2D ``[N*D, H]`` tensor and reshapes it
              internally to ``[N*D//4, H, 4]`` via ``TensorView``.
        bias: Optional bias tensor with shape [1, H]
        quantization_type: Type of quantization (NONE / STATIC / STATIC_MX).
            Quantization is only supported on the NKI kernel path; the PyTorch
            fallback will raise an AssertionError if a value other than NONE is
            supplied.
        input_scales: Per-tensor input scale, fp32. Required for STATIC and
            STATIC_MX. The o-proj CTE kernel asserts shape ``(128, 1)`` for
            both quantization types (broadcast scalar; see
            ``output_projection_cte_parameters.py``).
        weight_scales: Per-tensor weight dequant scale, fp32. Same shape
            contract as ``input_scales``: ``(128, 1)`` for STATIC and STATIC_MX.

    Returns:
        Output tensor with shape [B, S, H]

    Constraints (falls back to PyTorch if violated):
        - weight must be 2D tensor with shape [N*D, H]

        - bias (if provided) must have shape [1, H]
        - FP8 static quantization requires N or D to be even

    Notes:
        LNC sharding is performed on the weight tensor's hidden dimension.
