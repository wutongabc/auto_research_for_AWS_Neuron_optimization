# vLLM Plugin for AWS Neuron Documentation

The vLLM Neuron plugin brings the full vLLM serving stack to AWS Trainium
accelerators. It supports continuous batching, speculative decoding
(EAGLE3), disaggregated inference, structured outputs, multimodal models, and
more — all accessible through the standard `vllm serve` command and
OpenAI-compatible API.

For a high-level overview of inference on Neuron and help choosing the right
inference solution, see
[Inference on Neuron](/libraries/vllm-neuron/neuron-inference-overview).
