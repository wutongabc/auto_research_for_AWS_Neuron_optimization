"""
Example to demonstrate an optimized multi-process weight loading using shared memory to avoid loading a full
checkpoints into memory.

Essentially, we pipeline the following steps to maximize the overlap of data movement
1. Load weights into shared memory
2. Read shard of each weight tensor from shared memory
3. Write shard to device

Additionally, we start initializing Neuron Runtime in the background (as it is required before writing data to device)

For large models (e.g. Llama3 405B), creating the shard memory ends up taking up the majority of the time.

Before running, download weights to an NVMe-backed location and update MODEL_PATH as needed

Run using the following:
   > sync && sudo sh -c 'echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches'
   > python weight_loading_shared_memory.py
