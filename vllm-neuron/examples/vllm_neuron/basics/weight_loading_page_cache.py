"""
Example to demonstrate an optimized multi-process weight loading using an OS page cache as a shared memory
between processes.

Essentially, we pipeline the following steps to maximize the overlap of data movement
1. Fill up OS page cache with weights
2. Read shard of each weight tensor
3. Write shard to device

Additionally, we start initializing Neuron Runtime in the background (as it is required before writing data to device)

For large models (e.g. Llama3 405B), filling up the OS page cache ends up taking up the majority of the time.

Before running, download weights to an NVMe-backed location and update MODEL_PATH as needed

Run using the following:
   > sync && sudo sh -c 'echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches'
   > python weight_loading_page_cache.py

    Given a model checkpoint with 20 safetensor files, and a world size of 4,

    Subsequent accesses to the files will be able to read weights from the OS
    page cache (in OS memory) instead of the disk.

    We do this ahead of time to maximize disk IO bandwidth achieved when loading
    weights, and allow for faster access during sharding (where we have non-contiguous
    access patterns, which is extremely slow from disk). The added overhead of populating
    OS page cache ahead of time is recovered by the faster sharding times.
